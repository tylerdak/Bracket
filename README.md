# Bracket
### by Tyler Dakin

##### As of writing this I do not have plans to do a full write-up on this program.

The only files above necessary to run this program are:
- main.py
- isInt.py

The other files are used for testing purposes only. To create testing files for your personal use, simply create a list of items in any text editor, separated by newlines, and save it as a .csv file. The Python program, assuming all necessary packages and frameworks are installed, will ask the user to choose the .csv file themselves.

The only package used in this project is **tkinter**. The installation for the package varies across different operating systems. For example, for my computer I used Homebrew to install it (tcl-tk) rather than by using pip.
